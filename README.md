# Asteroid-Game_Java
This space shooter simulator is the final product of several projects I completed in my "Object Oriented Programming" (COP 3330) class.

It takes the number of asteroids to spawn as command line input. It creates its own Swing GUI, with simple rocket in the center and the asteroids spawning on the edge. The GUI is fully scalable while running, allowing you to change the simulation's experience by resizing the window. It uses the arrow keys to navigate the ship and the space bar to fire rockets that will destroy asteroids on impact.

My professor created the package "Blobz.jar" as a supporting package for the creation of the simulation. The compiled version, "AsteroidGame.jar" is included, as well as the java files used for compilation.
